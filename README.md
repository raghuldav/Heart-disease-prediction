# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early detection and prevention critically important. This project leverages **machine learning techniques** to analyze clinical and lifestyle data for accurate heart disease prediction, supporting early diagnosis and improved healthcare outcomes.

The workflow integrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous evaluation to ensure both **model performance and interpretability**.

## Project Description
The heart disease prediction pipeline begins with collecting patient data, including medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements. The dataset undergoes comprehensive preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection to improve data quality and relevance.

Multiple supervised machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

To enhance model reliability and prevent overfitting, **cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning** techniques are applied. The models are evaluated using standard classification metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix**. The best-performing model can be deployed as a clinical decision support system for real-time heart disease prediction.
